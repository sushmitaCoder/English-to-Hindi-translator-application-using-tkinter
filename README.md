# English-to-Hindi-translator-application-using-tkinter
In this repo I'm going to write python scripts to translate English word to Hindi word and bind it with a tkinter GUI application. I have used the englisttohindi module to translate the English word to the Hindi word. This program can translate English sentences to Hindi sentences too.

## Installation:

Run this code into your terminal:

    pip install englisttohindi

## Approach:

   We import englisttohindi modules.
   We are creating an object of EngtoHindi() by passing the message.
   we are using convert() methods for the translation.
